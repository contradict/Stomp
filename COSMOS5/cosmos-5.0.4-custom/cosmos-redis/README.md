# Setting up Redis users

**IMPORTANT:** When setting up COSMOS, please see the section at the bottom for changing the default passwords.

## The ACL file

Redis reads in the user configuration from an ACL file: [users.acl](./config/users.acl). Each line has the syntax `user <username> [on/off] <password> [keyspace] [commands]`

Passwords can be set in the ACL file as either the SHA-256 hash or plaintext. To use the hash, prefix it with a # symbol (example: `user bob on #3ff698674f294ba598e719e3bfef82d88836d363b9e6f74d4b684415542919da`). To use plaintext, prefix it with a > symbol (example: `user bob on >bobspassword`). Note that this file gets physically stored on the Redis server, so storing the passwords in plaintext is not recommended.

### The users:

- cosmos

  - Default password: cosmospassword

  - This user is required, and it's used by COSMOS to connect to Redis. It has access to the entire keyspace, but its commands are restricted to what's necessary for COSMOS. As such, someone with this user has access to / ownership of all of the data stored in COSMOS; however, this user cannot reconfigure Redis itself.

- scriptrunner

  - Default password: scriptrunnerpassword

  - This user is required to use Script Runner. Script Runner needs Redis to keep track of the scripts it's running, but it has a user with limited access to prevent scripts from being able to destroy or access data they shouldn't be able to.

- admin

  - Default password: admin

  - This user is optional, but it's provided so that you can make changes to Redis while it's running. This won't be needed for normal operation of COSMOS. You can remove this user by deleting its line from the ACL file, or disable it by changing "on" to "off". Doing so would require a restart of Redis (with an amended ACL file that adds this user back) if configuration changes are needed.

  - It should be noted that the only commands this user has access to are those in the `@admin` category. However, that category includes the `ACL` command and all its subcommands, meaning that the user could grant themselves any other permission in Redis.

- default

  - This is the default user for Redis, which has permission to do anything and no password. This user is set to `off` to ensure that it can't be used.

  - You can enable this user if you want a simple way to expose certain commands without needing authentication. For example `user default on nopass -@all +ping` would let anyone ping Redis, but nothing else.

## The .env file

[This file](../.env) contains the plaintext credentials used by COSMOS to access Redis, which are loaded in as environment variables.

## CHANGING THE PASSWORDS WHEN SETTING UP COSMOS

A utility script has been provided to calculate the SHA-256 hash of a string.

        COSMOS> cosmos-control.bat util hash yourpasswordhere

1.  Pick a new password for the 'cosmos' user.

    - Set that value in plaintext to the `COSMOS_REDIS_PASSWORD` variable in .env
    - Set it as either plaintext or its SHA-256 hash in the ACL file, as described above (with > or #)

1.  Pick a new password for the 'admin' user, or disable the user by changing "on" to "off", or delete the line if you do not want an admin user.

    - If you choose to keep the user enabled, the only place you need to put its password is in the ACL file.
