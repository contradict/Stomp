# NOTE: Telemetry definitions are processed in alphabetical order by default.
#   However, this can be overridden by explicitly calling them out in target.txt.
#   Thus it's recommended to create a file like this with an extension
#   such as inst_tlm_override.txt which will be processed AFTER inst_tlm.txt.

# Existing telemetry packets can be selected and items modified
SELECT_TELEMETRY <%= target_name %> MECH
  # Existing items can be selected and modified by adding conversions, limits, etc
  SELECT_ITEM SLRPNL1
    LIMITS DEFAULT 1 ENABLED -180.0 -170.0 170.0 180.0
  # Delete an item so it doesn't appear in the packet
